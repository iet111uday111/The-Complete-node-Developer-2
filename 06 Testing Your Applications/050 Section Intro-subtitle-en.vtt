Hello and welcome to Section 7 testing your node applications and this section we're going to look at

00:06.840 --> 00:10.740
how we can test our code to make sure it's working as expected.

00:10.740 --> 00:16.190
Now if you set up test cases for other languages then you know how hard it can be to get started.

00:16.260 --> 00:21.260
You have to set up the actual test infrastructure and then you have to write your individual test cases.

00:21.390 --> 00:26.370
Every time I didn't test an application it was because the set up process and the tools available to

00:26.370 --> 00:27.710
me were such a burden.

00:27.720 --> 00:32.460
Then you dig around for information on line and you get really simple examples but not examples for

00:32.460 --> 00:37.220
testing real world things like asynchronous code or express applications.

00:37.290 --> 00:39.480
We're going to be doing all of that in this section.

00:39.480 --> 00:43.990
I'm going to give you a very simple setup for testing and writing your test cases.

00:44.010 --> 00:46.000
We're going to look at the best tools available.

00:46.080 --> 00:51.490
So you'll actually be excited to write those test cases and see all of those green checkmarks.

00:51.630 --> 00:54.120
We're going to be testing from here on out as well.

00:54.180 --> 00:58.140
So let's go ahead and dive in looking at how we can test some code
