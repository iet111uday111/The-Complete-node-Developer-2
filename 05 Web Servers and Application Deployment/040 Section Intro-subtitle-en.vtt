00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.970
Hello and welcome to Section 5 web servers and application deployment we're covering a ton of exciting

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.290
stuff in this section.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.210
You're going to learn how to make a web server.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.160
You're going to learn how to integrate a version control into node applications.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.780
And finally you're going to learn how to deploy your node apps which means that you have a you are Alan

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.610
anyone who visits that you r l can view your application.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.730
Now do you get all that done we are going to be looking at a framework called Express.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.200
It's one of the most popular NPM libraries and for good reason it makes it really easy to do stuff like

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.590
create a web server or an h t t p API.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.290
Kind of like the dark sky API we used in the last section.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.030
Now most courses start here.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.300
They start with Express and I think that's confusing because it blurs the line between what is node

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.230
and what is Express which is why we've waited so long to talk about it.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.840
Don't get me wrong it's a fantastic library but I wanted to wait a little bit to introduce it now that

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.960
I am introducing it.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.980
So let's go ahead and kick things off.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.130
Adding express to a brand new node app
